# CalculatorAPI
A simple API I made for my placement training

Port: localhost:5000

APIs:
1. sum - To find the sum of two numbers.
2. diff - To find the difference between two numbers.
3. prod - To find the product of two numbers.
4. div - To find the quotient between two numbers.

Instructions:
1. Add any of the APIs to the end of the port number e.g., localhost:5000/sum
2. Input the values in a JSON format in the body of the request e.g.
   {
      "firstNum":<value>,
      "secondNum":<value>
   }
 3. output will be displayed in JSON format.
